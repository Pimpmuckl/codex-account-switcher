# Changelog

## v0.1.4 - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Restored the Windows tray account table so active and saved accounts show plan, weekly remaining percentage, and weekly reset time again.
- Improved tray table alignment in native Windows menus by using the menu detail column plus fixed-width percentage formatting.
- Kept active-account display informational while saved-account rows remain clickable switch targets.

## v0.1.3 - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added optional auto-start usage-window refreshes. When enabled, the app checks saved accounts every five minutes and starts overdue weekly Codex usage windows with a minimal isolated `codex exec` ping.
- Added controls for the new refresh behavior in the persistent TUI, the Windows tray menu, and the `auto-start-usage-windows` CLI command.
- Added a tray checkmark for `Auto-start usage windows`; enabling it from tray immediately kicks off a background check without blocking the tray menu.
- Added `AGENTS.md` with brief repo instructions and commit-message examples for future agent work.

### Changed

- TUI account rows now show weekly reset dates with 24-hour time, for example `Reset: 2026-05-12 13:56`.
- Auto-start pings now run in a temporary `CODEX_HOME` seeded from the saved snapshot, so active app/CLI sessions keep their cached auth and the live Codex auth home is not swapped.
- Auto-start refreshes now keep using the active app environment, serialize concurrent manual/tray/background checks, preserve cached usage metadata on write-back, and scrub temporary auth material after cleanup edge cases.
- The tray menu now uses simple `Active:` and `Saved:` sections with email-only account rows instead of dense plan/status/usage columns.
- Startup/status rendering is faster because process detection now refreshes only the process fields the app actually displays.

### Fixed

- Removed the awkward `Which account do you want to activate?` prompt from activation flows.
- Hardened `auto-start-usage-windows --disable --run` so disabling remains disable-only.
- Fixed newer Clippy warnings on Rust 1.95 across Windows, macOS, and Linux CI.
